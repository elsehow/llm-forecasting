      "reasoning": "These questions are highly positively correlated since they measure the same event (Iranian regime fall) over overlapping time periods. If A occurs (regime falls by March 31), then B must also occur (falls before 2027). However, B can occur without A (regime could fall between April 2025 and 2027), so it's not perfect correlation. The shared underlying factors affecting regime stability create strong positive dependence between these outcomes."

      "reasoning": "These questions are highly positively correlated because they measure the same underlying event (Russia-Ukraine ceasefire) with overlapping timeframes. If a ceasefire occurs by January 31, 2026, then Question B is automatically satisfied since March 31 is later. However, the correlation isn't perfect (+1) because a ceasefire could occur between February 1 and March 31, 2026, making A false but B true. The strong positive correlation reflects that the same geopolitical factors and peace processes would influence both outcomes."

US strikes on Iran could destabilize the regime and potentially lead to Khamenei's removal, while internal Iranian instability that removes Khamenei might increase the likelihood of US military action due to regional chaos or power vacuum. However, many scenarios exist where either event occurs independently - Khamenei could leave due to natural causes/internal politics without US involvement, and US strikes could happen while Khamenei remains in power. The correlation is positive but modest since both events involve Iranian political stability but through different causal pathways."

An Israeli strike on Iran could destabilize the Iranian regime and potentially lead to Khamenei's removal, while internal Iranian instability might also increase the likelihood of Israeli military action.

Bitcoin and XRP are positively correlated as crypto assets that often move together during market-wide events like regulatory news, macro conditions, or risk sentiment shifts. A Bitcoin dip to $85k would likely coincide with broader crypto market weakness that would also pressure XRP toward $1.80. However, correlation isn't perfect since XRP has unique factors (regulatory status, different use cases) that can cause divergent price action."

However, they're different assets with distinct use cases and market dynamics - Bitcoin as digital gold vs XRP as a payments token. A strong crypto bull market would increase odds for both, but they could diverge based on asset-specific factors like regulation or adoption."

If Bitcoin dips to $85,000, it would need an extraordinary ~35% rally to then reach $115,000 in the same month, making both outcomes simultaneously very unlikely. High volatility could theoretically allow both, preventing perfect negative correlation, but generally one outcome makes the other much less probable."

If the Fed decreases rates in January 2026 (Question A = YES), they are less likely to hold rates unchanged in March 2026 (Question B = NO), as rate cuts often signal ongoing easing cycles. However, the correlation isn't perfect (-1) because the Fed could cut in January then pause in March depending on economic conditions, and there's a two-month gap between meetings allowing for new data to influence decisions."

The fall of the Iranian regime is a geopolitical event driven by domestic Iranian politics, international relations, and regional dynamics. Kim Kardashian winning the 2028 US Presidential Election is primarily about US domestic politics, celebrity culture, and electoral processes. While major global instability could theoretically create conditions where unconventional political outcomes become more likely, the connection is extremely weak and indirect. The correlation is essentially zero with perhaps a tiny positive component due to both representing low-probability disruptive events."
