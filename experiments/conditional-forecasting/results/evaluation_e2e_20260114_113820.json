If Bitcoin surges to $115k, it would likely indicate strong crypto market momentum that could lift XRP above $1.80. However, the correlation is moderate rather than strong because: (1) XRP and Bitcoin can sometimes move independently due to different use cases and investor bases, (2) XRP's price level of $1.80 isn't extremely low relative to recent ranges, and (3) crypto correlations are imperfect even during broad market moves.",
          "reasoning": "Bitcoin reaching $115k requires significant bullish momentum from current levels (~$95k). The negative correlation of -0.30 suggests that if XRP dips to $1.80 (indicating crypto market weakness or risk-off sentiment), Bitcoin's chances of hitting $115k decrease substantially. The correlation is moderate, so I update from 25% base probability down to 15% when conditioning on XRP weakness."

          "reasoning": "Bitcoin reaching $115k suggests strong crypto market conditions, while XRP dipping to $1.80 suggests weakness. These events are somewhat negatively correlated as they imply opposite market sentiments, though not perfectly since individual crypto assets can move independently. The correlation is moderate negative (-0.3) rather than strong because crypto markets can be highly volatile with asset-specific factors. If XRP dips significantly, it slightly reduces the probability of Bitcoin reaching new highs due to potential broader market uncertainty."
