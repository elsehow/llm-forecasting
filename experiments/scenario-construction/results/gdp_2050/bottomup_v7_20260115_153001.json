Question A about US GDP in 2050 is a broader, long-term economic indicator, while Question B is more specific about the potential impact of AI on key economic metrics by 2028. A strong positive GDP growth trend by 2050 (Question A) would make it less likely that there is a visible break in economic trends by 2028 due to AI (Question B). Conversely, a visible disruption to economic trends by 2028 could dampen the long-term GDP growth outlook. Therefore, the two questions are somewhat positively correlated, but not perfectly so, hence the estimated correlation coefficient of 0.5."
