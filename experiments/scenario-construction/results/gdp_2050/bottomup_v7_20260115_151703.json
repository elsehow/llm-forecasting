A higher level of real GDP in 2050 would generally indicate a stronger economy, which would make it less likely for the Federal Reserve to have a negative target policy rate. Conversely, a weaker economy in 2050 with lower real GDP would increase the probability of the Federal Reserve needing to implement negative interest rates. Therefore, I estimate a moderately strong negative correlation coefficient of -0.7 between these two prediction market questions."

  "mece_reasoning": "These scenarios are MECE because they partition the outcome space along GDP ranges that cannot overlap:\n- Crisis & Collapse ($15-25T): Fundamental economic breakdown\n- Stagnant Muddle ($35-45T): Persistent low growth \n- Moderate Progress ($55-70T): Steady baseline growth\n- AI Transformation ($80-120T): Transformative acceleration\n\nEach represents a distinct economic trajectory that precludes the others. You cannot simultaneously have economic collapse and AI-driven boom, or stagnation and transformative growth. The scenarios are differentiated by their core growth dynamics and institutional capacity, creating mutually exclusive world-states while covering the full range of plausible 2050 GDP outcomes from crisis to transformation.",
