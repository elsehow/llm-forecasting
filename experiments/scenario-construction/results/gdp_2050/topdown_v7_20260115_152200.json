Each scenario is defined by mutually exclusive combinations of key drivers - you cannot simultaneously have both AI breakthrough productivity AND economic stagnation, or both manageable climate adaptation AND climate crisis disruption. The scenarios exhaust the possibility space from economic collapse to technological prosperity.",
