The Steady Growth scenario ($45-65T) represents baseline continuation without major disruptions or breakthroughs. The Geopolitical Disruption scenario ($30-45T) covers outcomes where conflicts and institutional breakdown are the dominant factor. The Climate Crisis scenario ($25-40T) addresses the lowest outcomes where environmental impacts overwhelm other factors. Each scenario requires mutually exclusive conditions - you cannot simultaneously have both transformative AI gains AND geopolitical collapse as the primary economic driver, nor can you have both high growth AND climate-driven economic devastation. The outcome ranges are non-overlapping, ensuring mutual exclusivity while covering the full plausible range from climate catastrophe to AI-driven boom.",
