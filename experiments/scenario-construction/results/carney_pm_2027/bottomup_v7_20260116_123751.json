Carney, former Governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, won the leadership on the first ballot with strong support from the party establishment. He has not yet faced a general election as PM. The next federal election must be held by October 2025 at the latest. Current polling (January 2026) shows the Liberals with a slight lead over the Conservatives (recent polls: Nanos L39-C36, Ipsos L40-C37, Pallas L41-C38), a reversal from the significant Conservative lead before Carney took office. Key issues: cost of living, housing affordability, US-Canada trade relations under the Trump administration.",

'Carney Consolidates Power' represents strong electoral victory and effective governance; 'Narrow Survival' captures close electoral success but precarious ongoing governance; 'Electoral Defeat' covers loss of power entirely. These are mutually exclusive world-states that cannot coexist - a leader cannot simultaneously consolidate power, narrowly survive, and be defeated. They are collectively exhaustive as they cover the full spectrum from electoral defeat through narrow victory to strong mandate, encompassing all realistic political outcomes for Carney's tenure.",
  "coverage_gaps": "Minimal gaps exist. The scenarios cover electoral outcomes from defeat to strong victory and governance outcomes from removal to consolidation. The only minor gap might be scenarios involving Carney stepping down voluntarily before 2027, but given the context and timeline, this appears highly unlikely and would represent a very small probability space.",
