Carney, former Governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, won the leadership on the first ballot with strong support from the party establishment. He has not yet faced a general election as PM. The next federal election must be held by October 2025 at the latest. Current polling (January 2026) shows the Liberals with a slight lead over the Conservatives (recent polls: Nanos L39-C36, Ipsos L40-C37, Pallas L41-C38), a reversal from the significant Conservative lead before Carney took office. Key issues: cost of living, housing affordability, US-Canada trade relations under the Trump administration.",

'Party Revolt' requires active internal rebellion that is incompatible with the party unity needed for resurgence or the external focus of crisis scenarios.
