  "mece_reasoning": "These scenarios are MECE because they partition the GDP outcome space into non-overlapping ranges: Crisis & Stagnation ($32-36T), Moderate Recovery ($36-42T), Trump Policy Surge ($42-46T), and Technology Boom ($46-52T). Each scenario represents a fundamentally different growth regime: (1) structural weakness/crisis with <1.5% growth, (2) historical baseline with 2-3% growth, (3) policy-driven acceleration with 3-4% growth, and (4) technology-driven transformation with >4% growth. These growth patterns are mutually exclusive - the economy cannot simultaneously experience crisis-level weakness and policy-driven acceleration, or follow both baseline trends and technology-driven transformation. The scenarios are collectively exhaustive, covering the full plausible range from economic crisis (reflecting current recession fears and geopolitical risks) to technology-driven boom (reflecting AI potential), with baseline and policy-driven scenarios covering the middle ground.",
  "coverage_gaps": "The scenarios cover the full plausible range of outcomes. The only potential gap might be extreme tail scenarios (major financial collapse <$32T or transformational breakthrough >$52T), but these represent <5% probability events that are reasonably excluded from the core scenario set.",
