Each represents a fundamentally different economic state that cannot coexist with the others. The AI Boom requires sustained high productivity and growth that's incompatible with stagnation or crisis. Steady Expansion represents the baseline middle path excluding both extreme outcomes. Policy Stagnation requires specific headwinds (high debt, trade wars, monetary tightening) that would prevent high growth. Economic Crisis requires recession conditions that are definitionally exclusive of expansion. The ranges cover the full plausible space from severe contraction to exceptional AI-driven growth, with probabilities based on current signal likelihoods.",
