Current polling (January 2026): Trump approval 41.9%, disapproval 55% (Silver Bulletin). Generic congressional ballot: Democrats 42.6%, Republicans 38.8% (Decision Desk HQ) - a reversal from the 2024 election environment. Democratic field: No clear frontrunner. Potential candidates include governors Gavin Newsom (CA), Gretchen Whitmer (MI), Josh Shapiro (PA), and JB Pritzker (IL). Vice President Kamala Harris's 2024 loss may complicate another run. Republican field: Wide open with no obvious Trump successor. JD Vance (current VP) is positioned but untested. Other potential candidates include Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and figures from the 2024 primary. Key factors: Trump administration performance over next 2 years, economic conditions, tariff/trade policy outcomes, Democratic party rebuilding post-2024.",

  "mece_reasoning": "These scenarios are MECE because they partition the political landscape along two key dimensions: (1) the overall political environment (pro-Democratic wave, pro-Republican strength, technological disruption, or balanced competition) and (2) the stability vs. disruption of traditional political patterns. Each scenario represents a fundamentally different world-state:\n\n- Democratic Resurgence assumes sustained Republican weakness and Democratic ascendance\n- Republican Renewal assumes continued GOP strength and Democratic struggles  \n- Chaotic Realignment assumes fundamental disruption to normal politics via technology and crises\n- Competitive Balance assumes stable, traditional political competition\n\nThese cannot occur simultaneously because they represent mutually exclusive political environments. The scenarios exhaust the possibility space by covering the spectrum from strong Democratic advantage through balanced competition to strong Republican advantage, plus the orthogonal possibility of technological/geopolitical disruption.",
  "coverage_gaps": "Minimal gaps. The scenarios cover the full spectrum of political environments from Democratic wave to Republican strength to technological disruption to balanced competition. One minor gap might be a specific scenario focused solely on a major economic boom favoring Republicans, but this is largely captured within the Republican Renewal scenario.",
