Additionally, the two questions are measuring related aspects of the energy and chemical industries, though they are not directly measuring the same underlying phenomenon. They are not mutually exclusive, as it is possible for both renewable energy sources to grow and biomass-derived chemicals to achieve price parity. However, they are not entirely independent, as the growth of renewable energy could influence the competitiveness of biomass-derived chemicals.
