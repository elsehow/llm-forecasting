Additionally, if a nuclear weapon were detonated, it could have significant environmental and economic impacts that could disrupt the growth of renewable energy.

However, the relationship is not perfect as there are many other factors that influence global temperature change. Additionally, the two questions are not measuring the same underlying phenomenon, but are related in the context of climate change and energy transition.

  "mece_reasoning": "These scenarios are MECE because they partition the outcome space along two key dimensions: (1) the nature of driving forces (crisis-driven vs technology-driven vs emergency mobilization vs steady progress) and (2) non-overlapping outcome ranges for renewable energy share. Each scenario represents a fundamentally different world state:\n\n- Crisis Stagnation (25-40%): Multiple converging disasters prevent transition\n- Moderate Progress (40-60%): Steady advancement under stable conditions  \n- Emergency Acceleration (60-80%): Climate crisis triggers mobilization\n- Technology Breakthrough (75-90%): Innovation makes renewables dominant\n\nThe scenarios are mutually exclusive because they represent different causal pathways and societal responses that cannot simultaneously occur. The outcome ranges are designed to be adjacent but non-overlapping, with some intentional overlap between Emergency Acceleration and Technology Breakthrough (60-80% vs 75-90%) to reflect that both could theoretically achieve similar high outcomes through different mechanisms, but the small overlap represents uncertainty in distinguishing between crisis-driven vs technology-driven paths in that range.",
