Each scenario occupies a distinct range of GDP outcomes ($32-40T, $40-55T, $50-62T, $55-70T) with some intentional overlap between Moderate Resilience and Green Innovation Boom to reflect uncertainty boundaries. The scenarios are mutually exclusive because they represent fundamentally different states of how major forces (AI/automation, climate adaptation, geopolitical competition) resolve - they cannot simultaneously be net positive and net negative, or result in both stagnation and boom conditions. They are collectively exhaustive by covering the full spectrum from crisis (climate/tech disruption overwhelms adaptation) to various forms of growth (tech-driven, green-driven, or moderate).",
