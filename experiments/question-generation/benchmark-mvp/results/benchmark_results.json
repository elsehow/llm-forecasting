If Khamenei were to be removed, it could lead to political and economic instability, which could in turn cause the rial to depreciate. Additionally, the two questions are measuring related underlying phenomena - the stability of the Iranian political and economic system. However, the questions are not mutually exclusive, as Khamenei's removal does not necessarily guarantee a 20% depreciation of the rial, and vice versa.
