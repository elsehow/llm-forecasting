If no ceasefire by January 31 (Q=no), there's still 2 months for one to occur, but the window is shorter and failure by January suggests ongoing obstacles - giving P(X|Q=no) a lower but non-zero probability.

If Microsoft is #1 on Jan 31 (Q=yes), it suggests Microsoft has strong momentum and market favor, making it harder for Alphabet to overtake by June 30 - this lowers P(X|Q=yes). If Microsoft is NOT #1 on Jan 31 (Q=no), it means either Apple, Nvidia, or possibly Alphabet itself is leading, which opens more opportunity for Alphabet to reach #1 by June.
