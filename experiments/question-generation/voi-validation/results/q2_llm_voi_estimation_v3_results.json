News that moves Q down (escalation, failed negotiations, new offensives) will move X down too, though X has more time buffer so it won't fall as sharply. The correlation is very high but not perfect because X can still succeed even if the January deadline is missed - there's a 2-month window where X-specific news could diverge. Given P(Q)=50% and P(X)=19.5%, the low X price suggests markets see the January deadline as unlikely to lead to lasting ceasefire, or significant skepticism overall. P(X|Q=no) must be low since missing January leaves only 2 months.",

Conversely, if rates stay higher (Q=no), it could mean inflation concerns persist, potentially making a hawkish Warsh nomination more appealing to Trump. However, the correlation is weak because Warsh nomination depends primarily on Trump's personnel decisions and timing, not directly on Fed rate policy.

      "llm_reasoning": "News that moves both UP: General 'establishment governors are strong candidates' sentiment, news about governor track records being valued by voters, or polling showing voters want executive experience over congressional/outsider candidates. News that moves both DOWN: Anti-establishment wave, populist sentiment rising, scandals affecting sitting governors generally, or news favoring non-governor candidates (senators, outsiders). OPPOSITE directions: If DeSantis wins the presidency, it might signal Republican strength and a tough general election environment, which could slightly boost Newsom as Democrats seek a strong counter-candidate. However, a DeSantis win also means the Democratic nominee lost, which doesn't directly affect who that nominee was. The correlation is weakly positive because both are establishment governors whose fortunes rise/fall with 'competent governor' narratives, though they're in different parties and different races.",

Unlike the Trump/Warsh/Waller example where shared sentiment drives positive correlation, here the news that moves prices tends to be OPPOSITE: News favoring progressive/outsider candidates (Bernie momentum, leftward shift in party) would push Bernie UP and Newsom DOWN. News favoring establishment/moderate candidates (party consolidation around mainstream figures) would push Newsom UP and Bernie DOWN. Both are serious contenders at similar probability levels, making them direct competitors rather than fringe alternatives sharing 'change' sentiment. The strong negative correlation reflects their head-to-head competition for the same nomination.",
