      "reasoning": "Marc Sumerlin, a former NEC deputy director under Trump, would likely be more dovish than other potential nominees and favor stable rates in early 2026. If Trump nominates him (15% chance given other strong candidates), there's a 65% chance of no rate change as Sumerlin would likely prioritize economic stability. If someone else is nominated, they may be more hawkish or reactive to economic conditions, giving only 35% chance of unchanged rates. The Fed chair's philosophy significantly influences rate decisions, especially in uncertain economic periods.",

If they don't raise rates, Cut-Cut-Pause becomes more plausible as it represents a dovish trajectory consistent with not raising rates.
