The opposing force dominates because they are mutually exclusive at the most basic level. | Magnitude: If Trump is out as President by March 31, he would lose the authority to nominate a Fed chair, making it nearly impossible for him to nominate Kevin Warsh.

The shared drivers (Trump's selection preferences) are likely already priced in since both are known Trump-affiliated candidates.

The dominant uncertainty is WHO he will choose among specific candidates. Hassett and Bowman represent different profiles - Hassett is a former Trump economic advisor with outside experience, while Bowman is a current Fed governor.

When Trump appears more likely to serve a full term, 'Trump out before 2027' goes down while 'no nominations' also becomes less likely (he'd have time/opportunity to nominate). The logical opposition is weaker because 'no nominations' isn't just about inability due to being out of office - it could also reflect policy choices or political gridlock while in office. | Magnitude: If Trump is out as President before 2027, he loses the primary constitutional power to make nominations to federal positions.

If Waller becomes Fed chair, markets would expect less accommodative policy and fewer rate cuts. This policy implication dominates the shared 'Trump makes changes' driver. | Magnitude: Rate cuts by January 2026 would suggest dovish Fed policy, making Trump less likely to nominate the relatively hawkish Waller as chair.

When recession fears or dovish sentiment increase, both 'Fed will cut significantly' and 'Fed will pause cutting' can rise together as the overall easing cycle becomes more likely. The shared macro uncertainty dominates the timing competition between them. | Magnitude: If the Fed holds rates steady in March 2026, it suggests they may be pausing before a potential easing cycle, making a subsequent 50+ bp cut more likely than if they had already been cutting aggressively.

The nomination is zero-sum, and they would likely compete for different voter bases rather than rise/fall together on shared factors. Unlike cases where similar candidates benefit from the same trend, these represent distinct pathways to nomination. | Magnitude: If Newsom wins the 2028 Democratic nomination, it directly precludes Mamdani from winning it since only one person can receive the nomination.

Health scares, legal issues, or political crises would simultaneously increase early departure odds and decrease 2028 election prospects. The shared uncertainty about Trump's ability to maintain power dominates the logical exclusivity, creating negative correlation where both prices move down together when Trump appears stronger/more stable. | Magnitude: If Trump is out as President before 2027, it likely means he either lost/didn't run in 2024, faced impeachment/removal, health issues, or other major political setbacks.

The competitive dynamic dominates - news favoring Lindsey directly reduces Warsh's probability and vice versa. | Magnitude: Since Trump can only nominate one person as Fed chair, if he nominates Kevin Warsh, it makes Larry Lindsey's nomination nearly impossible. This is close to a perfect negative relationship - the positions are mutually exclusive with only one Fed chair role available.",

Newsom winning the Democratic nomination creates a specific matchup scenario that directly impacts DeSantis's general election chances. The shared political drivers are already largely priced in, so the competitive dynamic where a strong Democratic nominee hurts Republican chances becomes the primary correlation driver. | Magnitude: If DeSantis wins the 2028 presidential election, it suggests a strong Republican performance and likely means the Democratic nominee (potentially Newsom) lost. However, Newsom could still win the Democratic nomination even if he ultimately loses the general election to DeSantis. The relationship is meaningful since a DeSantis victory indicates Democratic defeat, but it doesn't directly determine whether Newsom specifically gets the nomination over other potential Democratic candidates.",
