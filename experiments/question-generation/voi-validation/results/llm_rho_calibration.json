If the Fed cuts rates twice then pauses (Cut-Cut-Pause), this suggests a dovish stance and economic concerns that would make aggressive rate increases by 25+ bps after January 2026 less likely, as it indicates the Fed is in an easing cycle rather than a tightening cycle. | Magnitude: A Cut-Cut-Pause pattern indicates the Fed is actively easing monetary policy due to economic concerns, which would make aggressive rate hikes just months later highly unlikely unless there's a dramatic economic reversal.
