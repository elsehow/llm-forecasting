A stronger Democratic nominee could reduce DeSantis's chances of winning the general election. However, the very weak correlation (-0.04) suggests either the market doesn't see this relationship as strong, or there are many other factors (like who the actual Republican nominee will be) that dominate the relationship. The connection exists but is indirect and contingent on multiple other outcomes."
