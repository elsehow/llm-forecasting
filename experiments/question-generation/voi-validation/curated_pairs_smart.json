A Trump who would nominate Ron Paul (a libertarian anti-Fed figure) suggests he's maintaining his outsider appeal and has significant political capital, which would correlate with his ability to secure the 2028 nomination. However, the relationship is indirect since Fed chair nominations depend on winning 2024 first, and many other factors influence presidential nominations."

        "rationale": "There is a plausible causal mechanism where Trump nominating Bullard as Fed chair could influence future interest rate decisions, as Fed chairs have significant influence over monetary policy. However, the relationship is indirect since: (1) the nomination would need Senate confirmation, (2) Fed decisions are made by committee not just the chair, (3) the April 2026 timeline is distant and many economic factors could intervene, and (4) we don't know Bullard's specific policy preferences. The 0.30 correlation suggests markets see some connection, likely based on perceived dovish/hawkish tendencies, but the relationship involves multiple steps and uncertainties."
