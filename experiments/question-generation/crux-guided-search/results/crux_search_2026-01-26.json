While Question B (whether there will be no change in Fed interest rates after the March 2026 meeting) is not identical to Question A (whether there will be no change in Fed interest rates after the January 2026 meeting), the two questions are closely related and share common underlying factors. The Fed's interest rate decisions are typically made at regular intervals, so the outcome of the March 2026 meeting could provide meaningful insight into the likelihood of no change in rates after the January 2026 meeting. However, there are also other factors that could influence the Fed's decisions, so the relationship is not a direct logical necessity.",

If there are changes in the market's expectations about the Fed's future policy actions, such as the timing and magnitude of rate hikes or cuts, this would likely move both prices in the same direction, even if the specific outcomes described in the two questions are mutually exclusive. The shared driver of the overall interest rate and monetary policy outlook is likely to be the dominant factor affecting the correlation between these two prediction market prices. | Magnitude: If there are 5 Fed rate cuts in 2026, it would likely indicate a significant economic downturn that could lead to the Fed keeping interest rates unchanged after the January 2026 meeting. This suggests a moderate relationship between the two events, as the rate cuts would be a meaningful but not dominant factor in the Fed's decision.",
