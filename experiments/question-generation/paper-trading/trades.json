However, he'll face strong competition from other 2028 candidates, his Minnesota base doesn't directly translate to Iowa advantage, and VP nominees historically have mixed success in subsequent primaries. Iowa's early state status gives outsized importance to retail politics where Walz could perform well, but the field will likely include senators, governors, and other prominent Democrats. Base rate for former VP nominees reaching top 3 in early states is moderate."

While Abbott faces some intraparty criticism over certain policies, he remains popular with the Republican base that dominates Texas elections.

Most political scandals involve financial impropriety or abuse of power over time - she has limited executive experience where such issues typically arise.

By 2028, established figures like DeSantis, potential Trump family members, or other governors/senators will likely have stronger organizational support, fundraising, and endorsements. The 40% delegate threshold by Super Tuesday is substantial - typically requiring either incumbent advantage or very strong establishment backing. Base rates suggest non-establishment candidates rarely achieve such dominance early in primaries, even when they have momentum."

The 2-year timeline to Dec 2026 aligns with typical early announcement patterns for 2028 cycle. Key factors supporting: her continued political activity, donor relationships, and positioning as Trump alternative. Main downside risks: Trump running again could crowd her lane, or she might pursue other offices first. Strong fundamentals and precedent suggest high likelihood of announcement."
