This falls under the 'Momentum/Reinforcement' rule, where recognition in one venue can increase the chances of recognition in another. | Magnitude: Winning the Critics Choice Award for Best Director would suggest that Ryan Coogler's work has been widely acclaimed by critics, which could increase the likelihood of him receiving a DGA Award nomination. However, the DGA nomination is ultimately decided by a different set of voters, so this connection is not a perfect determinant and would be considered a moderate relationship.",
