    "reasoning": "Under this AI transformation scenario, the US economy would experience dramatic productivity gains from AI automation across sectors. Starting from ~$28T in 2024, unprecedented AI-driven efficiency improvements could sustain 3.5-4% annual real GDP growth through 2040, well above historical averages. The median estimate of $42T represents roughly 50% higher GDP than baseline projections. The wide confidence interval reflects uncertainty about AI adoption speed, regulatory responses, and potential disruptions from rapid economic transformation. Lower bound assumes significant transition costs and uneven benefits; upper bound reflects potential for exponential productivity gains in knowledge work, manufacturing, and services."

The median assumes ~50% cumulative real growth from 2024's ~$27T base, driven by massive green infrastructure spending, climate adaptation investments, and technological innovation, but constrained by frequent climate disasters reducing productivity by 15-25% compared to normal growth trajectories. High uncertainty reflects potential for either economic collapse from cascading climate failures (low end) or successful mobilization creating a climate-resilient economy with new growth drivers (high end)."

However, economic decoupling could also drive domestic innovation and reshoring of manufacturing. Assuming 2024 US GDP around $27T, this represents roughly 1.0% average annual real growth through 2040 - well below historical norms due to trade fragmentation, geopolitical tensions, and reduced efficiency from global economic integration. The wide confidence interval reflects substantial uncertainty around the severity of decoupling and the US's ability to adapt through domestic investment and alliance-building with aligned nations."

Positive factors include: increased immigration flows as younger populations from developing countries seek opportunities, potentially offsetting domestic aging; productivity gains from AI/automation responding to labor constraints; and the US's relatively favorable demographic position compared to Europe/East Asia. Negative factors include: slower labor force growth as domestic fertility declines; increased fiscal pressures from aging population requiring higher government spending on healthcare/Social Security; and potential global economic slowdown from demographic headwinds in major trading partners. The scenario suggests significant structural changes requiring adaptation, creating both opportunities and challenges.

While historical pandemics show eventual recovery, the described severity suggests lasting impacts on productivity and economic structure. Assuming current US GDP around $27T in 2024, normal growth would suggest ~$35T by 2040, but the biological catastrophe likely reduces this by 20-35% through lower growth rates, one-time GDP losses, and structural economic changes.

However, technological automation and capital concentration could provide countervailing downward pressure. The fragmented global economy would likely favor labor-intensive domestic production over capital-intensive global supply chains, supporting a modest increase in labor share by 2035."

    "reasoning": "The Great Demographic Transition scenario suggests labor scarcity in the US by 2035, which should strengthen workers' bargaining power and increase labor's share of GDP. Historical US labor share has ranged 57-64% since 1970, currently around 58%. Labor shortages from demographic shifts, reduced immigration from source countries also experiencing transitions, and an aging workforce should drive wages up relative to capital returns. However, continued automation and AI adoption may partially offset these gains. The scenario points toward the higher end of historical ranges."

    "reasoning": "In an Innovation Plateau World, labor's bargaining position strengthens as automation threats diminish and traditional industries remain competitive. With AI development hitting barriers, the capital-biased technological change of recent decades slows significantly. This allows labor share to recover from its current ~58% level toward the historical 60-65% range seen in the 1970s-1990s. Modest economic growth and reduced productivity gains mean returns to capital don't dramatically outpace wages. However, existing capital stock and some technological advantages prevent a complete reversion to pre-1980s levels above 65%."

    "reasoning": "A financial system breakdown would likely reduce capital availability and shift power toward labor. Mass unemployment initially depresses wages, but capital scarcity and potential policy responses (stronger unions, fiscal stimulus favoring workers) would eventually increase labor's share.

The incremental nature of change suggests steady but not dramatic shifts. Factors supporting higher labor share include: potential minimum wage adjustments, stronger collective bargaining, and policies addressing inequality.

The PRC may prefer economic integration over military action to access Taiwan's AI capabilities. However, AI could also enhance military capabilities and surveillance, potentially emboldening more aggressive moves.

This creates competing pressures: internal focus on climate adaptation may reduce Beijing's capacity for military action against Taiwan, while climate-induced instability could also make Beijing more aggressive to distract from domestic problems. Taiwan's strategic semiconductor industry becomes even more critical during global restructuring, potentially increasing international protection. However, resource competition and climate migration could destabilize the region. The probabilities reflect Taiwan maintaining autonomy as most likely due to crisis-driven priorities elsewhere, but with significant risks of escalating tensions through blockade or conflict as climate pressures intensify geopolitical competition."

The breakdown of global institutions weakens deterrence mechanisms and diplomatic solutions. China likely perceives this fragmentation as an opportunity to resolve the Taiwan issue while the US is distracted by multiple global challenges. Economic decoupling reduces Taiwan's strategic value to China as a tech hub, making forceful reunification more attractive. However, Taiwan's strategic importance to US military positioning in the Pacific remains high. The most likely scenario is either a successful Chinese blockade leading to negotiated reunification, or PRC administration following a short conflict. Pure self-governance becomes less sustainable without robust international support systems."

However, demographic decline could also create urgency for territorial consolidation before further weakening. Taiwan's own aging society may face reduced defense capabilities and economic pressures that make resistance more difficult. The scenario likely increases economic interdependence and migration flows that could either strengthen ties or create new tensions.

The collapse of traditional insurance markets and sovereign debt crises would create structural upward pressure on yields as investors demand compensation for increased default risk perceptions, even for US Treasuries. The median of 6.5% reflects this risk premium expansion above historical norms, while the wide confidence interval captures uncertainty about whether safe-haven flows or fiscal concerns prove more powerful over the decade-long timeframe."
